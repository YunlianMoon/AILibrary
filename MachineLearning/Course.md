# Machine Learning Coures

A curated list of courses dedicated to machine learning.

I have spent a day looking for some latest courses about machine learning, but sadly, I have not found any newly opened courses including slides and videos from 2017 to 2018. 

I recorded some courses with detailed information, including teaching institution, publishing history, publishing platform, and so on.
